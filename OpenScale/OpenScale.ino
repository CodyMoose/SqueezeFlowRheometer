  OpenScale is a simple board that allows a user to read and configure all types of load cells.
  It relies on the HX711 load cell amplifier.

  How to use:
  1) Wire your load cell to the board using the 4-pin connection (E+/-, A+/-) or the RJ45 connection.
  2) Attach board to USB and open terminal at 9600bps
  3) Press x to bring up settings menu
  4) Select units LBS/KG
  5) Tare the scale with no weight on the scale
  6) Calibrate the scale: Remove any weight, start calibration routine, place weight on scale, type
  in the weight placed on the scale.
  7) Press x and test your scale

  OpenScale ships with an Arduino/Optiboot 115200bps serial bootloader running at 16MHz so you can load new firmware
  with a simple serial connection. Select 'Arduino Uno' under the boards menu to reprogram the board.

  OpenScale runs at 9600bps by default. This is configurable to 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200bps.

  After power up OpenScale will try reading the load cell and output a weight value.

  If you get OpenScale stuck into an unknown baudrate, there is a safety mechanism built-in. Tie the RX pin
  to ground and power up OpenScale. You should see the status LED blink at 1Hz for 2 seconds.
  Now power down OpenScale and remove the RX/GND jumper. OpenScale is now reset to 9600bps.

  To change the baud rate type 'x' to bring up configuration menu. Select the baud rate sub menu and enter
  the baud rate of your choice. You will then see a message for example 'Going to 9600bps...'.
  You will need to power down OpenScale, change your system UART settings to match the new OpenScale
  baud rate and then power OpenScale back up.

  STAT LED / D13 - toggles after each report

  If you're using this firmware with the HX711 breakout and an Uno here are the pins to hook up:
  Arduino pin 2 -> HX711 CLK
  3 -> DAT
  5V -> VCC
  GND -> GND

  Firmware versions:
  v1.0 - Original release
  v1.1 - Added trigger character
  v1.2 - 
  * Cleaned up white space and split to tabs for easier function finding
  * Changed the input method of many menu settings from the tedious +/- method
  to text enter. Now you can calibrate your system by typing in '0.5762' and OpenScale
  will figure out all the calibration factors.
  * Fixed a bug with the EEPROM defaulting to the wrong values
